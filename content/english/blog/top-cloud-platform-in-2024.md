Cloud services are becoming more popular by the day in current times. As developers, we have regularly included the word cloud in our thoughts. I will take a deeper look at it, and therefore provide a lengthy guide on top clouds that one can use from the year 2024. However, let’s discuss cloud platforms before anything else to know what they are and why they are used. Let us start learning about the cloud.

{{< toc >}}

## What is Cloud?

The term ‘cloud’ refers to the delivery of computer-related services such as software, storage devices, servers and networking via the Internet. By using services without owning them, physical cloud service providers give benefits to their customers for using these services. Based on your needs you can choose multiple plans for reaching those services on a rental basis or until your purpose is done with them, you may also quit. Subscription-based options allow you to access those services whenever needed usage-wise; almost every cloud offers a pay-as-you-go facility

## Types of Cloud Services

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS offers virtualised computer resources over the Internet. Companies can lease virtual machines, storage and networks on a pay-as-you-go basis, making it flexible, scalable and without physical hardware.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: PaaS proposes a platform that allows developers to build, deploy and handle applications without bothering about the underlying infrastructure. In other words, it supplies tools and frameworks for application development thus enhancing efficiency thereof.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: SaaS involves delivering software applications over the internet as subscription services. This means that users can access these applications via web browsers without having to install or maintain any software on their local systems. Examples of such are email services, customer relationship management (CRM) software and productivity suites

## Key Benefits of Cloud Services:

1. **Scalability**: The scalability of cloud services allows businesses to scale up or down depending on need, ensuring optimal performance and affordable costs. This scalability is particularly beneficial for varying workloads and seasonal demand peaks.

2. **Cost Savings**: Organizations can save significantly from implementing cloud services due to the absence of upfront costs for infrastructure as well as reduced maintenance expenses. Budget allocation is made efficient when companies only pay for the resources they use through pay-as-you-go pricing models.

3. Flexibility and Accessibility**: Data and applications can be accessed remotely from any location with an internet connection via cloud services. This flexibility encourages collaboration, telecommuting, and seamless resource access which in turn promotes productivity and efficiency.

4. **Reliability and Security**: Prominent cloud service providers employ substantial investments involving robust infrastructure enhancements as well as security features aimed at ensuring high availability levels alongside data safety. Cloud services are more reliable and secure than in-house traditional solutions because they have redundant systems, automated backups, and better security protocols.

5. **Innovation and Agility**: Rapid business innovation is supported by the availability of cutting-edge technologies through cloud services.  Cutting-edge technology can be accessed through PaaS

## Top Cloud Platforms for 2024

I have selected these cloud platforms from the [StackOverflow survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-cloud-platforms). Here is the result of the survey :point_down:

Let's explore each one one by one

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

![AWS image](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto/images/amazon%20Web%20Services-%20erreaS%20_B9vY4f4N.jpg)

It is an understatement to say that [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) was a trailblazer in the world of cloud computing, completely transforming how companies use technology. This comprehensive suite of cloud-based services came up in 2006 after being initiated by Amazon.com providing companies with a flexible, scalable and reliable infrastructure.

Through AWS, businesses can remove the burden of managing their infrastructure thus enabling them to concentrate on innovation as well as growth. From computational power to storage solutions and databases to machine learning capabilities; AWS provides a vast range of options that address multiple business requirements.

Firstly, one of the greatest advantages that AWS has is its widespread presence which is sustained by data centers located globally for ensuring low latency and high availability. With this kind of global footprint, enterprises can launch applications and services nearer to their clients thereby ensuring good user experience regardless of where they are situated.

Again, security and compliance form top priorities for AWS with strong measures put in place to preserve customer data together with meeting regulatory needs across many industries. The organisation's commitment towards security is complemented by continuous improvement practices plus a broad web of partners and developers has made it the most preferred cloud provider by organisations of all industries and sizes.

### Microsoft Azure

Another crucial faction of the cloud computing environment is [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in). It offers various services and solutions that enable organisations to realize their digital objectives. Since its launch in 2010, it has grown into one of the leading cloud platforms, with powerful tools and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

Azure also consists of computerization, storage, networking, databases, analysis software systems and artificial intelligence among others that support the seamless building, deployment and management of applications. Thus Azure can be used to build revolutionary software applications by analyzing large data sets or creating sophisticated models for AI purposes.

Amongst the useful parts of Azure is its hybrid functions which allow combination between on-premises infrastructures and those on the Cloud without any hitches at all. Hybrid approaches give flexibility and control so firms can make the best use of what they already have while benefiting from scalability as well as agility brought by moving part of an organization’s IT resources such as processing power outside their premises or offices to external locations which are linked together over networks known as cloud computing.

### Google Cloud Platform

![google](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto/images/google-glgggoeo_uSI1c89n.jpg)

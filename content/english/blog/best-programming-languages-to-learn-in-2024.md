## C++

C++ is a general-purpose, cross-platform programming language created as an extension of C by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s. Consequently, the features of OOPs imperative and generic programming languages are combined in C++. C++ provides developers with a great amount of control over memory and system resources and  **speed and efficiency**, allowing them to design and construct high-performance programs.

{{< notice "note" >}}
The typical entry-level C++ developer salary in the United States is $80,000 per year (or $38.5 per hour), as reported by Glassdoor. Experienced C++ engineers make an average of $115,000 annually (or $55.3 per hour), whereas mid-level C++ developers earn around $95,000 per year (or $45.7 per hour).

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a general-purpose, statically typed programming language. Because its primary objective is the  JVM, its architecture is entirely compatible with Java. It also compiles to javascript or native code, making the development of Android applications considerably faster and more efficient. As a result, kotlin has a promising  **future in Android development**.

{{< notice "note" >}}
The average entry-level Kotlin developer salary in the United States is $85,000 per year (or $40.9 per hour), according to data from Indeed. Experienced Kotlin engineers command an average annual salary of $120,000 (or $57.7 per hour), while mid-level Kotlin developers typically make around $100,000 per year (or $48.1 per hour), as reported by Glassdoor.

## Javascript

Javascript is a multi-paradigm, high-level web programming language. It supports both declarative and imperative object-oriented programming techniques. Text data, regular expressions, and standard data structures are all supported by Javascript's application programming interfaces (API).  It is one of the three essential technologies that power the internet, together with HTML and CSS.

{{< notice "note" >}}
The median entry-level JavaScript developer salary in the United States is approximately $75,000 per year (or $36.1 per hour), based on data from Glassdoor. Experienced JavaScript engineers earn an average annual salary of $110,000 (or $52.9 per hour), while mid-level JavaScript developers typically make around $90,000 per year (or $43.3 per hour), as reported by Indeed.

## My story

Hey there, folks! I’m the one and only Harendra Kumar Kanojiya, your friendly neighborhood FSD (Full-stack developer)! Yep, I’m the kind of person who loves innovation so much that even my breakfast cereal comes with a side of fresh new ideas. My superpower? Facing problems with a big, cheesy smile that could brighten the gloomiest of code bugs! Oh, and trust me, I solve those pesky bugs faster than you can say “variable declaration”! I’m all about efficiency, you see. I calculate my time like a pro, making every second count as I weave my magical coding spells! So, if you need some code wizardry or a hearty laugh, I’m your guy! 😉

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code for Golang
![Setting Up Visual Studio Code for Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Setup_VS_Code_m0r8s2.png)


Having a strong and effective Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will greatly improve your coding experience as you dive deeper into the realm of Go programming. Go programming is easily supported by the well-liked and adaptable code editor Visual Studio Code (VSCode). We'll walk you through configuring VSCode for Golang in this article so you have the resources you need to optimise your development process.


## Why Use Visual Studio Code for Go?

Visual Studio Code is a great option for Go programming because of its reputation for being feature-rich but lightweight. Both novice and seasoned developers will find VSCode to be a pleasant environment because to its abundance of extensions and user-friendly UI. You may take use of features like intelligent code completion, an integrated terminal, and robust debugging capabilities by setting up VSCode for Go.


## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

If you haven't already installed VSCode, you can download it from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

## Step 2: Install the Go Extension

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by using the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + X`.

2. Search for "Go" in the Extensions view search box.

3. Install the "Go" extension provided by the Go Team at Google.

4. Once the installation is complete, you may need to reload VSCode to activate the extension.

## Step 3: Configure Your Workspace

1. Open your Go project folder or create a new one.

2. Create a new file named `go.mod` in the root of your project. This file will manage your project's dependencies.

3. Open a terminal within VSCode (`Ctrl + `), navigate to your project folder, and run:

   ```bash
   go mod init example.com/myproject
   ```

   Replace `example.com/myproject` with your project's import path.

## Step 4: Configure Go Tools

1. Open the VSCode settings by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner and selecting "Settings."

2. Click on the "Extensions" tab on the left sidebar.

3. Scroll down and find the "Go" section. You can customize various settings here, such as formatting options and workspace-specific configurations.

## Step 5: Install Additional Tools (Optional)

The Go extension for VSCode comes with built-in support for many Go tools. However, you might want to install additional tools for specific tasks. Open a terminal within VSCode and install the desired tools using the `go get` command. For example:

```bash
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru
go get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode
```

## Step 6: Start Coding!

With Visual Studio Code setup for Go, you're now ready to start coding. Launch your Go files, take use of the Go extension's robust capabilities, and experience intelligent code completion. VSCode will make your Golang development experience easy and fun by helping you with formatting, error checking, and code navigation.

Best wishes! You've successfully configured Visual Studio Code to work with Go code. Now, use your new coding environment by diving into our Golang lesson for beginners! Have fun with coding!


## Hello, World Program in Golang

![Hello, World Program in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Hello_World_swy1tu.png)

1. Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Create a new file with a `.go` extension, for example, `hello.go`.

Now, let's write the "Hello, World!" program in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Explanation:

- `package main`: Every Go program starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is special—it indicates that this is the entry point of the program.

- `import "fmt"`: This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatting and printing output.

- `func main() { ... }`: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. When you run a Go program, it automatically starts executing from the `main` function.

- `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`: This line prints the "Hello, World!" message to the console. The `Println` function from the `fmt` package is used to print a line of text followed by a newline.

Once you've written the program, save the file. Now, you can run it using the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.go` file.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Go program. This simple "Hello, World!" example is a great starting point for exploring more complex features and concepts in the Go programming language.

## Golang workspace

![Golang workspace](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345249/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Go_workspace_xmq90j.png)

The way that Go handles code and dependencies is based on the idea of a workspace. In essence, a Go workspace is a directory structure that complies with certain standards required by the Go tools. The workspace contains three primary directories: `src`, `pkg`, and `bin`.

Here's a breakdown of each directory in a typical Go workspace:

1. **src (source):** This is where your Go source code resides. Each Go project should be organized as a separate directory under `src`. For example, if your project is hosted on GitHub at `github.com/yourusername/yourproject`, your project structure should mirror this URL, with the root of your project located at `src/github.com/yourusername/yourproject`.

2. **pkg (package):** This directory holds compiled package objects. When you build a Go program, the compiled packages are stored here. It is also divided based on the architecture and operating system. For instance, `pkg/linux_amd64` will contain packages compiled for 64-bit Linux systems.

3. **bin (binary):** The `bin` directory stores executable binaries after compilation. As with `pkg`, it is also divided based on the architecture and operating system.

When working with Go, it's common to have a single workspace for all your Go projects. This is because Go expects to find your code in a specific location within the workspace.

### Setting Up a Go Workspace:

1. **Create a Workspace Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/go
   ```

2. **Set GOPATH Environment Variable:**
   Add the following line to your shell profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export GOPATH=~/go
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   ```

   Then, run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc for zsh
   ```

3. **Organize Your Project:**
   Create a directory for your Go project inside the `src` directory. For example:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/yourusername/yourproject
   ```

   Place your Go source files in this directory.

4. **Build and Run:**
   You can build and run your Go programs from anywhere on your system. For example:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/yourusername/yourproject
   ```

   The executable will be in `~/go/bin/yourproject`.

You may help the Go tools handle your code and dependencies more efficiently by adhering to certain rules. It's crucial to note that you may operate outside of the GOPATH with Go modules, which were introduced in Go 1.11. This relaxes the requirement for a tight GOPATH. Still, knowing the GOPATH structure is helpful, particularly when collaborating on already-existing codebases or working on older projects.

## Variables in Golang

![Variables in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Variables_in_Go_zgv9cv.png)

Variables are used in Go to organise and store data. The `var` keyword is used to construct them, and the compiler can either automatically deduce their type or define them explicitly. Here are some instances of variables declared and used in Go:

### Example 1: Implicit Type Declaration

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Implicit type declaration
    var message = "Hello, Go!"

    fmt.Println(message)
}
```

In this example, the type of the variable `message` is implicitly inferred from the assigned value, which is a string.

### Example 2: Explicit Type Declaration

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Explicit type declaration
    var age int
    age = 25

    fmt.Println("Age:", age)
}
```

Here, we declare a variable `age` with an explicit type of `int`. We later assign a value of `25` to it and print the result.

### Example 3: Short Variable Declaration

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Short variable declaration
    name := "John"

    fmt.Println("Name:", name)
}
```

The short variable declaration `:=` is a concise way to declare and initialize a variable. The type is inferred from the assigned value.

### Example 4: Multiple Variables

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Multiple variables
    var (
        firstName = "Alice"
        lastName  = "Smith"
        age       = 30
    )

    fmt.Printf("Name: %s %s, Age: %d\n", firstName, lastName, age)
}
```

You can declare multiple variables at once using the `var` keyword with parentheses.

### Example 5: Constants

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Constants
    const pi = 3.14159

    fmt.Println("Value of pi:", pi)
}
```

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword. They must be assigned a value at the time of declaration and cannot be changed later.

### Example 6: Zero Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Zero values
    var zeroInt int
    var zeroFloat float64
    var zeroString string
    var zeroBool bool

    fmt.Printf("Zero int: %d\n", zeroInt)
    fmt.Printf("Zero float: %f\n", zeroFloat)
    fmt.Printf("Zero string: %s\n", zeroString)
    fmt.Printf("Zero bool: %t\n", zeroBool)
}
```

A variable's type determines the value allocated to it when it is defined but not explicitly initialised. These examples address a variety of topics related to using variables in Go. You will have a better grasp of how variables work in Go programmes by experimenting with these ideas.


## Strings in Golang

![Strings in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Strings_in_Go_hbekti.png)

Double quotes (`"..."`) are used in Go to express a string as a succession of characters. Go handles strings as immutable, which means that once a string is formed, it is impossible to modify its contents. The following are some essential components of using strings in Golang, along with illustrations:

### Declaring and Initializing Strings

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaring and initializing a string
    greeting := "Hello, Golang!"

    fmt.Println(greeting)
}
```

In this example, the variable `greeting` is declared and initialized with the string "Hello, Golang!" using the short variable declaration (`:=`) syntax.

### String Length

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    message := "Hello, World!"

    // Calculating string length
    length := len(message)

    fmt.Printf("Length of the string: %d\n", length)
}
```

The `len()` function is used to calculate the length of a string in terms of the number of bytes.

### Concatenating Strings

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    firstName := "John"
    lastName := "Doe"

    // Concatenating strings
    fullName := firstName + " " + lastName

    fmt.Println("Full Name:", fullName)
}
```

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator.

### String Indexing and Slicing

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    message := "Hello, Gophers!"

    // Accessing individual characters (byte-wise)
    firstChar := message[0]

    fmt.Println("First Character:", string(firstChar))

    // Slicing a string
    slicedString := message[7:15]

    fmt.Println("Sliced String:", slicedString)
}
```

In Go, strings are made up of bytes. You can access individual characters by indexing the string. Also, you can create a substring (sliced string) using the slice notation.

### String Formatting

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    name := "Alice"
    age := 25

    // String formatting using Printf
    message := fmt.Sprintf("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age)

    fmt.Println(message)
}
```

The `fmt.Sprintf` function is used for string formatting. It returns a formatted string without printing it to the console.

### Unicode Support

Go has excellent support for Unicode characters in strings, allowing you to work with a wide range of international characters.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    unicodeString := "こんにちは, 世界!" // Hello, World! in Japanese

    fmt.Println(unicodeString)
}
```


The Japanese phrase "Hello, World!" is represented by Unicode characters in the given string.

Some of the fundamental procedures and ideas associated with working with strings in Go are covered in these examples. You will be able to manage and deal with strings in your Go programmes more efficiently if you grasp these foundations.

## Arrays in Golang

![Arrays in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Arrays_in_Go_vd5p27.png)

An array in Go is a fixed-size grouping of identically typed items. An array's size cannot be altered once it has been constructed. An overview of declaring, initialising, and using arrays in Golang is provided here:

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaration and initialization of an array
    var numbers [5]int                 // An array of integers with a size of 5
    numbers = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}     // Initializing array elements individually
    moreNumbers := [5]int{6, 7, 8, 9, 10} // Short declaration with initialization

    fmt.Println("Numbers:", numbers)
    fmt.Println("More Numbers:", moreNumbers)
}
```

In this example, we declare and initialize an array called `numbers` with a size of 5. The elements are then assigned individually. The short declaration syntax is used for another array called `moreNumbers`.

### Accessing Array Elements

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Accessing array elements
    firstElement := numbers[0]
    thirdElement := numbers[2]

    fmt.Println("First Element:", firstElement)
    fmt.Println("Third Element:", thirdElement)
}
```

Array elements can be accessed using their index. The index starts from 0.

### Array Length

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Getting the length of the array
    length := len(numbers)

    fmt.Println("Length of the array:", length)
}
```

The `len()` function can be used to get the length (number of elements) of an array.

### Iterating Over Arrays

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Iterating over array elements
    for index, value := range numbers {
        fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
    }
}
```

The `range` keyword is used to iterate over the elements of an array, providing both the index and value at each iteration.

### Multidimensional Arrays

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaration and initialization of a 2D array
    var matrix [3][3]int
    matrix = [3][3]int{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9},
    }

    fmt.Println("Matrix:", matrix)
}
```


There are multidimensional arrays as well. A 2D array (`matrix`) is declared and initialised in this example.

Writing clear and simple code in Go requires knowing how to work with arrays, which are a basic data structure. Remember that slices offer a more adaptable substitute for arrays in situations where dynamic scaling is necessary.

## Slices in Golang

![Slices in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Slices_in_Go_zwiv0m.png)

A slice is a flexible, dynamically-sized view into an array's elements in Go. Compared to arrays, slices are more potent and adaptable because of their ability to dynamically alter size during runtime. An overview of declaring, creating, and working with slices in Golang is provided here:

### Declaring and Creating Slices

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaration and creation of a slice
    var numbers []int                // Declaration of an integer slice
    numbers = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}   // Initialization of the slice
    moreNumbers := []int{6, 7, 8, 9, 10} // Short declaration with initialization

    fmt.Println("Numbers:", numbers)
    fmt.Println("More Numbers:", moreNumbers)
}
```

In this example, we declare and initialize a slice called `numbers`. The size of a slice is not specified in the declaration, and it is determined by the number of elements provided during initialization.

### Accessing and Modifying Slice Elements

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Accessing and modifying slice elements
    firstElement := numbers[0]
    thirdElement := numbers[2]

    fmt.Println("First Element:", firstElement)

    numbers[1] = 20 // Modifying the second element
    fmt.Println("Modified Slice:", numbers)
}
```

Similar to arrays, you can access and modify elements of a slice using their index.

### Slicing Slices

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Slicing a slice
    slicedNumbers := numbers[1:4]

    fmt.Println("Sliced Numbers:", slicedNumbers)
}
```

Slices support a "slicing" operation to create a new slice from a subset of the original slice.

### Appending to Slices

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Appending elements to a slice
    numbers = append(numbers, 6, 7, 8)

    fmt.Println("Updated Slice:", numbers)
}
```

The `append` function is used to add elements to the end of a slice. If the underlying array is not large enough to accommodate the new elements, a new array is allocated, and the existing elements are copied.

### Length and Capacity of Slices

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Length of the slice
    length := len(numbers)

    // Capacity of the slice
    capacity := cap(numbers)

    fmt.Printf("Length: %d, Capacity: %d\n", length, capacity)
}
```

The `len()` function returns the length (number of elements) of a slice, while the `cap()` function returns the capacity (maximum number of elements it can hold without resizing).

### Copying Slices

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    anotherNumbers := make([]int, len(numbers))

    // Copying elements from one slice to another
    copy(anotherNumbers, numbers)

    fmt.Println("Copied Slice:", anotherNumbers)
}
```


To copy items from one slice to another, use the `copy` function. It is necessary to build the destination slice with sufficient capacity to hold the copied components.

Go's Slices data structure is strong and adaptable, allowing for the effective and dynamic manipulation of collections. Writing clear and effective Go code requires knowing how to interact with slices.


## Maps in Golang

![Maps in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345248/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Maps_in_Go_bhudg0.png)

A map in the Go language is an array of key-value pairs where every key has to be distinct. Because they are dynamic and unordered, maps make for quick and easy lookups and changes. An overview of declaring, creating, and using maps in Golang is provided here:


### Declaring and Creating Maps

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaration and creation of a map
    var colors map[string]string           // Declaration of a map with string keys and string values
    colors = make(map[string]string)      // Creating an empty map
    colors["red"] = "#ff0000"             // Adding key-value pairs to the map
    colors["green"] = "#00ff00"
    colors["blue"] = "#0000ff"

    fmt.Println("Colors:", colors)
}
```

In this example, we declare and create a map called `colors` with string keys and string values. The `make` function is used to create an empty map, and key-value pairs are added using the square bracket notation.

### Accessing and Modifying Map Elements

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    colors := make(map[string]string)

    // Adding key-value pairs
    colors["red"] = "#ff0000"
    colors["green"] = "#00ff00"
    colors["blue"] = "#0000ff"

    // Accessing and modifying map elements
    redHex := colors["red"]
    colors["green"] = "#008000"

    fmt.Println("Red Hex:", redHex)
    fmt.Println("Updated Colors:", colors)
}
```

Map elements can be accessed and modified using the key in square brackets.

### Deleting Map Elements

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    colors := map[string]string{
        "red":   "#ff0000",
        "green": "#00ff00",
        "blue":  "#0000ff",
    }

    // Deleting map elements
    delete(colors, "green")

    fmt.Println("Updated Colors:", colors)
}
```

The `delete` function is used to remove a key-value pair from the map.

### Checking for Existence

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    colors := map[string]string{
        "red":   "#ff0000",
        "green": "#00ff00",
        "blue":  "#0000ff",
    }

    // Checking for the existence of a key
    if value, exists := colors["green"]; exists {
        fmt.Println("Green Hex:", value)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Green key does not exist.")
    }
}
```

When checking for the existence of a key, the second return value from the map lookup indicates whether the key exists.

### Iterating Over Maps

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    colors := map[string]string{
        "red":   "#ff0000",
        "green": "#00ff00",
        "blue":  "#0000ff",
    }

    // Iterating over map elements
    for key, value := range colors {
        fmt.Printf("Key: %s, Value: %s\n", key, value)
    }
}
```

The `range` keyword is used to iterate over the key-value pairs in a map.

### Maps with Non-String Keys

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Map with non-string keys
    ages := map[string]int{
        "Alice": 25,
        "Bob":   30,
        "Charlie": 35,
    }

    fmt.Println("Ages:", ages)
}
```


Although strings are frequently used as keys, Go allows keys of any similar kind for maps as well.

In Go, maps are a strong and adaptable data structure that may be used in a variety of scenarios. Writing clear and simple Go code requires an understanding of how to interact with maps.


## Loops in Golang

![Loops in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Loops_in_Go_l4isbw.png)

The `for` loop is the sole kind of loop that exists in Go. Nonetheless, the `for` loop exhibits great flexibility and may be employed to accomplish diverse looping behaviours. Here are some Golang examples of loop usage:


### Basic `for` Loop

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Basic for loop
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

In this example, a basic `for` loop is used to print numbers from 0 to 4.

### `for` Loop with a Condition

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // For loop with a condition
    counter := 0
    for counter < 5 {
        fmt.Println(counter)
        counter++
    }
}
```

You can use a `for` loop with just a condition, similar to a while loop in other languages.

### Infinite Loop

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Infinite loop
    i := 0
    for {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i++
        if i == 5 {
            break // Exit the loop when i equals 5
        }
    }
}
```

By omitting the loop condition entirely, you create an infinite loop. You can use the `break` statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met.

### `for` Loop with Range

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // For loop with range (used for iterating over slices, arrays, maps, etc.)
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    for index, value := range numbers {
        fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
    }
}
```

The `range` keyword is used in a `for` loop to iterate over elements in slices, arrays, maps, and other data structures.

### Nested `for` Loop

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Nested for loop
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 2; j++ {
            fmt.Printf("i: %d, j: %d\n", i, j)
        }
    }
}
```

You can nest `for` loops to achieve multiple levels of iteration.

### Loop Control Statements: `break` and `continue`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Loop control statements: break and continue
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        if i == 2 {
            continue // Skip the current iteration when i equals 2
        }
        fmt.Println(i)
        if i == 3 {
            break // Exit the loop when i equals 3
        }
    }
}
```


The loop may be broken with the `break` statement, and the remaining iteration can be skipped to go on to the next one with the `continue` statement.

These examples cover a variety of `for} loop use scenarios in Go. You can develop more expressive and effective loop structures in your Go programmes if you grasp these ideas.


## Condition in Golang

![Condition in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Condition_in_Go_hce7yd.png)

The `if`, `else if`, and `else` phrases are used in Go to express conditionals. Here are some Golang instances of conditionals in use:


### `if` Statement

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Simple if statement
    age := 25
    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote.")
    }
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks if the `age` is greater than or equal to 18, and if true, it prints a message.

### `if` with Short Statement

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // If statement with a short statement
    if age := 25; age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote.")
    }
}
```

You can initialize a variable in the `if` statement itself, and its scope will be limited to that block.

### `if` and `else`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // If-else statement
    age := 15
    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
    }
}
```

Here, the `else` block is executed if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

### `if` with `else if`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // If-else if-else statement
    score := 85
    if score >= 90 {
        fmt.Println("A")
    } else if score >= 80 {
        fmt.Println("B")
    } else if score >= 70 {
        fmt.Println("C")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("D")
    }
}
```

You can use multiple `else if` statements to handle multiple conditions.

### Switch Statement

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Switch statement
    day := "Monday"
    switch day {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("It's the start of the week.")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("It's almost the weekend.")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a regular day.")
    }
}
```

The `switch` statement is used for multiple branches based on the value of an expression.

### `switch` with No Expression

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Switch statement with no expression
    today := "Sunday"
    switch {
    case today == "Saturday" || today == "Sunday":
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a weekday.")
    }
}
```

A `switch` statement without an expression can be used as an alternative to a long `if-else if-else` chain.

These examples demonstrate the use of conditionals in Go. Understanding how to use `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements allows you to make decisions and control the flow of your Go programs effectively.

## Operators in Go

![Operators in Go](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Operators_in_Go_lcmq8h.png)

Operators in Go are symbols that operate on operands. An outline of the most prevalent operator types in Go is provided below:

### Arithmetic Operators

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Arithmetic operators
    a := 10
    b := 3

    fmt.Println("Addition:", a+b)
    fmt.Println("Subtraction:", a-b)
    fmt.Println("Multiplication:", a*b)
    fmt.Println("Division:", a/b)
    fmt.Println("Remainder:", a%b)
    fmt.Println("Increment:", a+1)
    fmt.Println("Decrement:", a-1)
}
```

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Remainder (Modulus)
- `++` Increment
- `--` Decrement

### Relational Operators

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Relational operators
    x := 5
    y := 8

    fmt.Println("Equal:", x == y)
    fmt.Println("Not Equal:", x != y)
    fmt.Println("Greater Than:", x > y)
    fmt.Println("Less Than:", x < y)
    fmt.Println("Greater Than or Equal To:", x >= y)
    fmt.Println("Less Than or Equal To:", x <= y)
}
```

- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Logical operators
    isTrue := true
    isFalse := false

    fmt.Println("AND:", isTrue && isFalse)
    fmt.Println("OR:", isTrue || isFalse)
    fmt.Println("NOT:", !isTrue)
}
```

- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR
- `!` Logical NOT

### Assignment Operators

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Assignment operators
    a := 10
    b := 5

    a += b  // Equivalent to a = a + b
    fmt.Println("a:", a)

    a -= b  // Equivalent to a = a - b
    fmt.Println("a:", a)

    a *= b  // Equivalent to a = a * b
    fmt.Println("a:", a)

    a /= b  // Equivalent to a = a / b
    fmt.Println("a:", a)

    a %= b  // Equivalent to a = a % b
    fmt.Println("a:", a)
}
```

- `+=` Addition assignment
- `-=` Subtraction assignment
- `*=` Multiplication assignment
- `/=` Division assignment
- `%=` Remainder assignment

### Bitwise Operators

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Bitwise operators
    a := 5
    b := 3

    fmt.Println("AND:", a&b)
    fmt.Println("OR:", a|b)
    fmt.Println("XOR:", a^b)
    fmt.Println("AND NOT:", a&^b)
    fmt.Println("Left Shift:", a<<1)
    fmt.Println("Right Shift:", a>>1)
}
```

- `&` Bitwise AND
- `|` Bitwise OR
- `^` Bitwise XOR
- `&^` Bitwise AND NOT
- `<<` Left shift
- `>>` Right shift

In Go, these are the most frequently used operators. Writing efficient and clear Go code requires knowing how to utilise these operators.


## Structs in Golang

![Structs in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Structs_in_Go_hbr2nw.png)

A struct is a composite data type in Go that unifies variables, also known as fields, under a single name. A struct's fields may each have a distinct data type. Using structures, you may design user-defined types that group and encapsulate similar data points. An overview of Go's struct definition and usage can be found here:

### Defining a Struct

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct named 'Person'
type Person struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
    Age       int
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the 'Person' struct
    person1 := Person{
        FirstName: "John",
        LastName:  "Doe",
        Age:       30,
    }

    // Accessing struct fields
    fmt.Println("First Name:", person1.FirstName)
    fmt.Println("Last Name:", person1.LastName)
    fmt.Println("Age:", person1.Age)
}
```

In this example, a struct named `Person` is defined with three fields: `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`. An instance of this struct is created with specific values, and the fields are accessed using dot notation.

### Anonymous Structs

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Creating an anonymous struct
    person := struct {
        FirstName string
        LastName  string
        Age       int
    }{
        FirstName: "Alice",
        LastName:  "Smith",
        Age:       25,
    }

    fmt.Println("First Name:", person.FirstName)
    fmt.Println("Last Name:", person.LastName)
    fmt.Println("Age:", person.Age)
}
```

Anonymous structs are structs defined without a specified name. They are useful for creating one-time-use data structures.

### Struct Embedding (Composition)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a 'Contact' struct
type Contact struct {
    Email   string
    Phone   string
}

// Defining a 'Person' struct with embedded 'Contact'
type Person struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
    Age       int
    Contact   // Embedding the 'Contact' struct
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the 'Person' struct with embedded 'Contact'
    person := Person{
        FirstName: "Bob",
        LastName:  "Johnson",
        Age:       35,
        Contact: Contact{
            Email: "bob@example.com",
            Phone: "555-1234",
        },
    }

    fmt.Println("First Name:", person.FirstName)
    fmt.Println("Last Name:", person.LastName)
    fmt.Println("Age:", person.Age)
    fmt.Println("Email:", person.Email)  // Accessing embedded struct field
    fmt.Println("Phone:", person.Phone)  // Accessing embedded struct field
}
```

Struct embedding allows one struct to be embedded within another, forming a composition relationship.

### Methods with Structs

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a 'Person' struct
type Person struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
    Age       int
}

// Adding a method to the 'Person' struct
func (p Person) FullName() string {
    return p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the 'Person' struct
    person := Person{
        FirstName: "Charlie",
        LastName:  "Brown",
        Age:       28,
    }

    // Calling the 'FullName' method
    fullName := person.FullName()

    fmt.Println("Full Name:", fullName)
}
```


It is possible to define methods related to structs. In this example, the `Person` struct now has the `FullName` function attached to it.

Go's structures offer a strong and adaptable method for structuring and organising data in your programmes. They are frequently used to model real-world things and represent complicated data kinds.


## Functions in Golang

![Functions in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345246/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Functions_in_Go_hhbyzb.png)

Functions are code blocks in Go that carry out particular tasks. They are fundamental components of every Go programme. An overview of Golang function definition and use is provided here:

### Function Declaration

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function named 'sayHello'
func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'sayHello' function
    sayHello()
}
```

In this example, a function named `sayHello` is declared and defined. It prints "Hello, Go!" when called from the `main` function.

### Function Parameters

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function with parameters
func greet(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'greet' function with an argument
    greet("Alice")
    greet("Bob")
}
```

Functions can have parameters. The `greet` function takes a `name` parameter, allowing it to greet different individuals.

### Multiple Parameters

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function with multiple parameters
func add(a, b int) {
    result := a + b
    fmt.Printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, result)
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'add' function with two arguments
    add(3, 7)
}
```

Functions can have multiple parameters. The `add` function takes two integers as parameters and prints their sum.

### Return Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function with a return value
func multiply(a, b int) int {
    return a * b
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'multiply' function and using the returned value
    result := multiply(4, 5)
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}
```

Functions can return values. The `multiply` function takes two integers as parameters and returns their product.

### Named Return Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function with named return values
func divide(a, b float64) (quotient float64, remainder float64) {
    quotient = a / b
    remainder = a - (quotient * b)
    return
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'divide' function and using the returned values
    q, r := divide(10, 3)
    fmt.Printf("Quotient: %.2f, Remainder: %.2f\n", q, r)
}
```

You can specify named return values in the function signature. This example shows a function named `divide` that returns both the quotient and remainder.

### Variadic Functions

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Variadic function (accepts a variable number of arguments)
func sum(numbers ...int) int {
    total := 0
    for _, num := range numbers {
        total += num
    }
    return total
}

func main() {
    // Calling the 'sum' function with a variable number of arguments
    result := sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", result)
}
```

Variadic functions can accept a variable number of arguments. The `sum` function takes any number of integers and calculates their sum.

### Anonymous Functions (Closures)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Anonymous function (closure)
    add := func(a, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }

    // Calling the anonymous function
    result := add(8, 12)
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}
```

Anonymous functions, also known as closures, are functions without a name. They can be assigned to variables and used like any other function.

### Function as a Parameter

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Function that takes another function as a parameter
func operate(a, b int, operation func(int, int) int) {
    result := operation(a, b)
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}

func main() {
    // Defining an anonymous function and passing it as a parameter
    add := func(a, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }

    // Calling the 'operate' function with the 'add' function as a parameter
    operate(10, 5, add)
}
```


One function can pass another function as a parameter. A `operate` function that accepts two numbers and an additional function as parameters is demonstrated in this example.

Go functions are essential building blocks that help to better organise and structure code for modularity and reusability. It is essential to know how to define, call, and manipulate functions while building Go programmes.

## Pointers in Golang

![Pointers in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345247/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Pointers_in_Go_dzqn9c.png)

Pointers are variables in Go that hold the address of another variable in memory. They serve as an oblique reference to the value kept in a certain memory region. This is a summary of how to use pointers in Go:


### Declaring and Initializing Pointers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaring a variable and a pointer
    var value int = 42
    var pointer *int

    // Initializing the pointer with the address of the variable
    pointer = &value

    fmt.Println("Value:", value)
    fmt.Println("Pointer:", pointer)
}
```

In this example, a variable `value` is declared, and a pointer `pointer` is declared. The pointer is then initialized with the address of the `value` variable using the `&` operator.

### Dereferencing Pointers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaring a variable and a pointer
    var value int = 42
    var pointer *int

    // Initializing the pointer with the address of the variable
    pointer = &value

    // Dereferencing the pointer to get the value it points to
    dereferencedValue := *pointer

    fmt.Println("Value:", value)
    fmt.Println("Dereferenced Value:", dereferencedValue)
}
```

The `*` operator is used to dereference a pointer, which means accessing the value stored at the memory address held by the pointer.

### Modifying Variable through Pointers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaring a variable and a pointer
    var value int = 42
    var pointer *int

    // Initializing the pointer with the address of the variable
    pointer = &value

    // Modifying the variable through the pointer
    *pointer = 100

    fmt.Println("Modified Value:", value)
}
```

Since the pointer holds the memory address of a variable, modifying the value through the pointer also modifies the original variable.

### Nil Pointers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declaring a nil pointer
    var pointer *int

    // Checking if the pointer is nil
    if pointer == nil {
        fmt.Println("Pointer is nil")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Pointer is not nil")
    }
}
```

A pointer that is not assigned any memory address is called a "nil" pointer. It is the zero value for pointers in Go.

### New Function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Using the 'new' function to create a pointer
    pointer := new(int)

    // Assigning a value through the pointer
    *pointer = 42

    fmt.Println("Value assigned through 'new' pointer:", *pointer)
}
```

The `new` function is used to create a new variable and return its memory address as a pointer.

### Pointers with Structs

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct
type Person struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
    Age       int
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the struct
    person := Person{
        FirstName: "John",
        LastName:  "Doe",
        Age:       30,
    }

    // Creating a pointer to the struct
    var pointer *Person
    pointer = &person

    // Accessing struct fields through the pointer
    fmt.Println("First Name:", pointer.FirstName)
    fmt.Println("Last Name:", pointer.LastName)
    fmt.Println("Age:", pointer.Age)
}
```


A struct's fields can be accessed and changed via pointers. In this example, the fields of a `Person} struct are accessed by creating a reference to the struct.

Go's pointers let you directly manage and alter memory, giving you more control over how your programmes behave. Comprehending the usage of pointers is essential for advancing programming assignments and effective memory management in Go.

## Methods in Golang

![Methods in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345248/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Methods_in_Go_rxjwge.png)

Methods in Go are functions connected to a certain type. They let you specify actions or behaviours unique to instances of a particular kind. An outline of how to define and utilise methods in Go is provided below:

### Method Declaration

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct type
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

// Method associated with the Rectangle type
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the Rectangle struct
    rectangle := Rectangle{Width: 5, Height: 10}

    // Calling the method on the struct instance
    area := rectangle.Area()

    fmt.Println("Area:", area)
}
```

In this example, a method named `Area` is associated with the `Rectangle` type. The method is called on an instance of the `Rectangle` struct.

### Pointer Receivers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct type
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

// Method with a pointer receiver
func (r *Rectangle) Scale(factor float64) {
    r.Width *= factor
    r.Height *= factor
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the Rectangle struct
    rectangle := Rectangle{Width: 5, Height: 10}

    // Calling the method with a pointer receiver
    rectangle.Scale(2)

    fmt.Printf("Width: %.2f, Height: %.2f\n", rectangle.Width, rectangle.Height)
}
```

When a method has a pointer receiver, it can modify the values of the fields in the struct directly. In this example, the `Scale` method modifies the width and height of the `Rectangle` struct.

### Value Receivers vs. Pointer Receivers

The question of whether you wish to change the original value determines whether to use a value receiver or a pointer receiver.

- Use a value receiver if the method does not modify the original value.
- Use a pointer receiver if the method needs to modify the original value.

### Methods with Pointers as Parameters

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct type
type Point struct {
    X float64
    Y float64
}

// Method with a pointer receiver and a pointer parameter
func (p *Point) MoveTo(newX, newY float64) {
    p.X = newX
    p.Y = newY
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the Point struct
    point := Point{X: 3, Y: 7}

    // Calling the method with a pointer receiver and a pointer parameter
    point.MoveTo(10, 20)

    fmt.Printf("New X: %.2f, New Y: %.2f\n", point.X, point.Y)
}
```

Methods can also take pointers as parameters, allowing them to operate on different instances of the same type.

### Methods with Named Return Values

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining a struct type
type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

// Method with named return values
func (c Circle) DiameterAndCircumference() (diameter, circumference float64) {
    diameter = 2 * c.Radius
    circumference = 2 * 3.14 * c.Radius
    return
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the Circle struct
    circle := Circle{Radius: 5}

    // Calling the method with named return values
    diameter, circumference := circle.DiameterAndCircumference()

    fmt.Printf("Diameter: %.2f, Circumference: %.2f\n", diameter, circumference)
}
```


It is possible for methods to have named return values, which improves readability of the code and lets you utilise those names directly when returning values.

Go methods let you create actions linked to certain types, which improves code encapsulation and expressiveness. It's essential to grasp procedures if you want to write efficient, organised Go programmes.

## Interfaces in Golang

![Interfaces in Golang](https://res.cloudinary.com/harendra21/image/upload/v1705345249/golangwithexample/Golang%20Tutorial%20For%20Beginners/Golang_Tutorial_For_Beginners_-_Interfaces_in_Go_giw2bp.png)

Interfaces are a strong and adaptable method of defining contracts for behaviour in Go. Any type that implements these methods inherently fulfils the interface, which provides a set of method signatures. An overview of Go interface functionality is provided here:


### Defining an Interface

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining an interface named 'Shape'
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
    Perimeter() float64
}

// Defining a struct named 'Rectangle'
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

// Implementing the 'Shape' interface for 'Rectangle'
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

func (r Rectangle) Perimeter() float64 {
    return 2*r.Width + 2*r.Height
}

func main() {
    // Creating an instance of the 'Rectangle' struct
    rectangle := Rectangle{Width: 5, Height: 10}

    // Using the 'Shape' interface
    var shape Shape
    shape = rectangle

    // Calling methods defined by the 'Shape' interface
    area := shape.Area()
    perimeter := shape.Perimeter()

    fmt.Printf("Area: %.2f, Perimeter: %.2f\n", area, perimeter)
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` interface is defined with two methods: `Area` and `Perimeter`. The `Rectangle` struct implements these methods, making it implicitly satisfy the `Shape` interface.

### Interface with Multiple Implementations

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Defining an interface named 'Animal'
type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}

// Implementing the 'Animal' interface for 'Dog'
type Dog struct{}

func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof!"
}

// Implementing the 'Animal' interface for 'Cat'
type Cat struct{}

func (c Cat) Speak() string {
    return "Meow!"
}

func main() {
    // Creating instances of 'Dog' and 'Cat'
    dog := Dog{}
    cat := Cat{}

    // Using the 'Animal' interface with different implementations
    var animal Animal

    animal = dog
    fmt.Println("Dog says:", animal.Speak())

    animal = cat
    fmt.Println("Cat says:", animal.Speak())
}
```

In this example, the `Animal` interface is implemented by both the `Dog` and `Cat` types. This demonstrates that different types can satisfy the same interface.

### Empty Interface

The empty interface, denoted as `interface{}`, has zero methods and is satisfied by any type. It is often used when you want to work with values of different types without knowing their specific types.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(value interface{}) {
    fmt.Println("Value:", value)
}

func main() {
    // Using the empty interface
    printValue(42)
    printValue("Hello, Go!")
    printValue(3.14)
}
```

### Type Assertion

Type assertion is used to extract the underlying value of an interface. It checks the dynamic type of the interface value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var value interface{} = "Hello, Go!"

    // Type assertion to get the underlying string value
    stringValue, ok := value.(string)
    if ok {
        fmt.Println("String Value:", stringValue)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Not a string!")
    }
}
```

### Type Switch

A type switch is a switch statement specifically designed for type assertions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printType(value interface{}) {
    switch valueType := value.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Println("Type: int, Value:", valueType)
    case string:
        fmt.Println("Type: string, Value:", valueType)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown Type!")
    }
}

func main() {
    // Using a type switch
    printType(42)
    printType("Hello, Go!")
    printType(3.14)
}
```

Interfaces in Go provide a way to define flexible and reusable code by specifying behaviour contracts. They are a key feature for achieving polymorphism and decoupling in Go programs.
